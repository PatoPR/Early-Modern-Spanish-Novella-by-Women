For the author, the stories are complementary and fall within the genre of \"courtly novels.\" For Armon, the novels deploy a \"semiology of virtues\" expressed through courtesy and respectful behavior, surpassing the lineage of blood, and focusing on attitudes. The novels teach aspiring courtiers in the Court of the Habsburgs to exercise certain virtues, which the author calls the \"anatomy of courtesy.\" Each story outlines a moment of impasse that is resolved through some discreet action considered virtuous. Marriage serves as a narrative apparatus of purpose in each of the stories. For the author, Carvajal demonstrates how a woman can improve or consolidate her social status by exploiting courtly arts. The thesis is divided into 5 chapters. In Chapter 1 (8-70), Armon deals with the historical context of the genre of short stories in Spain. In Chapter 2 (71-115), he discusses the label \"collection\" in which Carvajal's novels have been classified and argues that they have a unit that gives them artistic coherence. Chapter 3 (116-192) contextualizes the historical significance of marriage in 4 patterns found in the plots of the novels. At the same time, it deals with Erving Goffman's concept of \"interaction rituals\" or objectified forms of social communication. Chapter 4 (193-242) addresses the art of courtesy in the novels, and Chapter 5 (243-313) compares the male and female power relationships of \"Navidades\" with those of another contemporary author, Mar\u00eda de Zayas.","In this article, the author analyzes the topics of chivalric novels in two Christmas stories. First, she points out that Navidades has a framing story that applies to all the short novels, following the model of Boccaccio's Decameron. In addition to the Italian author, Carvajal takes Cervantes and chivalric novels in general as her models, as can be clearly seen in La venus de Ferrara and Celos vengan desprecios. From page 644, she analyzes the chivalric topics in the first novel. From page 650, she analyzes the similarities between the novel Celos vengan desprecios and the chivalric novel Primale\u00f3n of 1512. Among the chivalric resources used, the most prominent are the chivalric space, disguise, themes such as honor, obstacles in the love relationship, and chivalric values. All of these elements, however, are stripped of their warlike quality and adapted to the tastes of the time.","This is an article in which the author explores the concept of the anatomy of manners or the courtier's user manual developed in her thesis. Additionally, she emphasizes the idea that these novels are also a collection of entertaining stories. The author highlights that in Carvajal's stories, the marital bond is consummated when the couples correspond to each other in both inheritance and moral attitudes. The means to achieve successful consummation are a set of courteous and virtuous behaviors.\n          The author suggests that performance is the central element in Carvajal's descriptions, which can take various forms, including heroic acts and verbal exchanges. She also emphasizes the double meaning of the word \"etiqueta\" in Spanish, which refers to both the rules and attitudes of behavior in certain spheres, as well as the label that something carries due to its attitudes or characteristics (i.e., tag in English).\n          The author insists on the idea that belonging to a lineage is not enough to be prestigious, but a set of good manners is required, or what she calls \"ritualized social performances\" that include reciting poetry, playing the lute, dancing, gift-giving, entertainment, conversational skills, and appropriate dress. All of these qualities combine to form a set of virtues called honor. In the plots of Carvajal's novels, characters who belong to noble families and exhibit these virtuous characteristics are successful.\n          For the author, Navidades fulfills two functions. First, as an example of storytelling, one of the virtues praised in the novels. Second, it serves as a guide for courteous behavior.\n          Among the most valued virtues is discretion. This functions as a signifier that organizes the rules of courtesy. Within discretion, we can list a set of highly valued virtues by the author, such as moderation, caution, good judgment, prudence, perspicacity, and common sense. In other words, a set of attitudes that encourage the restraint of impulses and more restrained behaviors.\n","This paper primarily analyzes the loci critici and concludes that in a part of the novel \"The Slave of His Slave\" there were two different writings, in different contexts in the writing process that resulted in \u201cun mismo pasaje se narra dos veces, en p\u00e1rrafos distintos, con frases muy similares y, a veces, id\u00e9nticas\u201d [\u201cthe same passage being narrated twice, in different paragraphs, with very similar and sometimes identical phrases\"] (105). But then it concludes that it is \u201cun error en el proceso de producci\u00f3n impresa en cualquiera de sus fases --composici\u00f3n, casado e imposici\u00f3n y tirada15- tampoco explicar\u00eda estos cambios tan sutiles pero sustanciales; cambios que como hemos visto demuestran que no se trata en absoluto de una repetici\u00f3n, sino de dos versiones distintas que revelan dos estadios de redacci\u00f3n\u201d [\"an error in the process of printed production in any of its phases -- composition, marriage and imposition and printing -- would not explain these subtle but substantial changes; changes that, as we have seen, demonstrate that it is not at all a repetition, but two different versions that reveal two stages of writing\"] (110).","         In this conference paper Nieves Romero-D\u00edaz discusses the significance of urban space as an element in defining the short novel genre in 17th century Spain. The author defines this genre as a cultural practice that discusses the transition of traditional noble principles to a more urban aristocracy. The paper focuses on Mariana de Carvajal's novel Celos vengan desprecios and the symbolism of two spaces, the city and the country estate, which represent conflicting social classes. The analysis of the novel explores the negotiation of patriarchal order to maintain hegemony in a society undergoing transformation. The conflict is also presented in terms of sexuality, with Carvajal questioning how to respond to social class conflict from the perspective of the subjugated group. The author argues that the analysis of this novel helps to understand the mechanisms of a patriarchal order. The paper shows how Carvajal's novel debates the reality of a changing society while entertaining readers. The paper also explores the meaning of two key characteristics, valor and prudence, and how they are renegotiated in the transition from military to urban aristocracy.\n         The text analyzes the character of Narcisa in the novel. The evasiveness of the character is discussed, which, although not resembling the traditional evasive woman in literature of the time, does represent opposition to male conquest and resolves in her acceptance of her condition as a woman. A comparison is made between the character and the mythological figure of Narcissus, recalling his rejection of Echo's love and his attraction to his own image reflected in the water, which in the novel becomes Narcisa's attraction to other women. The analysis focuses on the importance of female friendship as the main theme of the novel, and the possibility of a case of lesbianism is discussed but rejected as unlikely due to the conservative attitude of the time. Finally, the degeneration of the nobility represented in the characters of Duke Arnaldo and Count Leonido is analyzed, which makes the cruelty and haughtiness of Narcisa appear as positive characteristics. Caro's novel is seen as a social critique that highlights the importance of women as agents of change in sociocultural transformation.\n         The author then refers to three interventions that occur in different spaces and moments in the novel. In each one of them, a nobleman tries to attack the honor of the lady Narcisa, but only Don Duarte dares to defend her. The first intervention takes place in a quinta, where Count Leonido forces his way in to reproach Narcisa for her vanity. By defending her, Don Duarte demonstrates his masculinity and nobility. In the second attack, Duke Arnaldo violently snatches Narcisa's glove and challenges those present to defend her. Don Duarte, disguised with a mask, is the only one who dares to defend her in the city, where social relationships are central. In the third intervention, Duke Arnaldo tries to violate Narcisa in a space between the city and the quinta. With this violation, Arnaldo attempts to legitimize his social and sexual superiority, but demystifies the ideals of society and loses his privileges and status. The novel suggests that controlling and dominating a woman's body is a way to legitimize the social and gender supremacy of the noble.\n---. \u201cMariana de Carvajal como sujeto resistente: una revisi\u00f3n par\u00f3dica de la f\u00e1bula de Apolo y Dafne.\u201d C\u00e1nones cr\u00edticos en la poes\u00eda de los Siglos de Oro, editado por Pedro Ruiz, Academia del Hispanismo, 2008, p\u00e1gs. 235-248. \n         The article examines the emergence of burlesque mythology at the end of the 16th century and its development throughout the Baroque era. The author argues that writers such as Francisco de Quevedo and Salvador Jacinto Polo de Medina perfected the genre of burlesque mythology, which is characterized by its carnivalization of classical myths, and its degradation of their characters into more earthly and human forms. The author also explores the paradox of parody, which allows writers to subvert and transgress literary conventions while simultaneously relying on recognizable and accepted stories. Mariana de Carvajal and Saavedra, a woman writer from Spain, becomes a prime example of the use of parodic literature as a means of resistance against patriarchal structures. By reworking the myth of Apollo and Daphne, Carvajal subverts the original patriarchal narrative and empowers her female protagonist to resist Apollo's advances and maintain her agency. Through her parodic retelling, Carvajal challenges the dominant social norms and gender roles of her time. Overall, the article offers a comprehensive exploration of the development of burlesque mythology and its relationship to gender, power, and resistance.\n         The author discusses the use of transvestite ventriloquism in early modern literature, which consisted of the appropriation of the woman's voice by the man, reflecting the long cultural tradition of silencing women. However, the author Mariana de Carvajal reverses this linguistic transvestism through her female character Do\u00f1a Lucrecia, the head of the collection's gathering. By establishing the poetic voice as male, Carvajal manages to confront the limitations imposed by the definitions of the scriptural genres in which she participates and also confront the anxiety generated by the radical instability of gender difference in a particular cultural context. Using this double ventriloquism, Carvajal negotiates her position as a resistant subject within a dominant male tradition.\n         The poetic voice of the fable is at a crossroads when incorporating a parodic and revolutionary poem within a collection of novels that is governed by the norms of decorum and social and generic conformity. Through her knowledge of Quevedo and Polo de Medina's burlesque fables, Carvajal appropriates the male voice to have the power to legitimately dialogue with her male models and criticize the sexual and textual elements present in their works. The presence of the metapoetic element in the fable is evidenced using annotations and parentheses, which allows the poetic voice to position itself even more with respect to its models and establish itself as a resistant poet and reader. Ultimately, Carvajal uses transvestite ventriloquism as a tool to challenge the limitations imposed by the dominant literary tradition and establish her position as a critical and resistant subject.\n         Lastly, the author describes Carvajal's criticism of the representation that Quevedo and Polo de Medina made of the relationship between Apollo and Daphne as a sexual transaction with Daphne as a prostitute. Carvajal responds to the burlesque vision that establishes the relationship with the commercialization of women as objects of exchange. Carvajal uses Polo's specific \"painting\" to express his disapproval of prostitution in literature and the lack of respect for Daphne. Carvajal criticizes the way Polo had expressed the conquest of Daphne, pointing out that he could not give shoes \"without stockings\". This caveat is not coincidental within a collection in which Carvajal has demonstrated his virtuosity in terms of the high degree of knowledge of the customs of dress, food, and behavior of the upper-middle-class woman of the time. The meta-poetic voice points out that, in Polo de Medina's poem, Apollo has become a vulgar sexual \"aggressor\" who does not consider the rules of courtesy and virtuous discretion.\n"],["Link: www.proquest.com/docview/304064615?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true.
