For the author, the stories are complementary and fall within the genre of \"courtly novels.\" For Armon, the novels deploy a \"semiology of virtues\" expressed through courtesy and respectful behavior, surpassing the lineage of blood, and focusing on attitudes. The novels teach aspiring courtiers in the Court of the Habsburgs to exercise certain virtues, which the author calls the \"anatomy of courtesy.\" Each story outlines a moment of impasse that is resolved through some discreet action considered virtuous. Marriage serves as a narrative apparatus of purpose in each of the stories. For the author, Carvajal demonstrates how a woman can improve or consolidate her social status by exploiting courtly arts. The thesis is divided into 5 chapters. In Chapter 1 (8-70), Armon deals with the historical context of the genre of short stories in Spain. In Chapter 2 (71-115), he discusses the label \"collection\" in which Carvajal's novels have been classified and argues that they have a unit that gives them artistic coherence. Chapter 3 (116-192) contextualizes the historical significance of marriage in 4 patterns found in the plots of the novels. At the same time, it deals with Erving Goffman's concept of \"interaction rituals\" or objectified forms of social communication. Chapter 4 (193-242) addresses the art of courtesy in the novels, and Chapter 5 (243-313) compares the male and female power relationships of \"Navidades\" with those of another contemporary author, Mar\u00eda de Zayas.","This is an excerpt from an essay on the relationship between architecture and literature in collections of Spanish short novels from the seventeenth century. The author highlights how literary texts, when related to their surroundings, acquire a spatial dimension that turns them into a small world, a literary garden. The essay focuses on the introductory zone or preamble of these collections, which the author compares to a vestibule or narrative frame, a peripheral element of fictional works that can be found in the genealogy of an architectural term. The author explores the spatial notions present in architecture and painting of the time, to better understand the function of the narrative frame in these collections of Spanish short novels from the seventeenth century.\n         The article is about the presence of gardens in the narrative frame of post-Cervantes\u2019s collections of short novels. The author notes that although many critics consider these frames to be conventional and imprecise, it is necessary to analyze the message they convey. The author is inspired by the work of critic Daniel Arasse, who questions whether the details in a pictorial work have the function of conveying parcel information or if they can mean much more. The author highlights four post-Cervantes works that present garden-like narrative frames: \"Parte Primera de varias aplicaciones, y Transformaciones\" by Diego Rosel, \"Teatro popular: novelas morales\" by Francisco de Lugo y D\u00e1vila, \"Tardes entretenidas\" by Alonso de Castillo Sol\u00f3rzano, and \"Navidades de Madrid y noches entretenidas\" by Mariana de Carvajal.\n          In the case of the work \"Navidades de Madrid y noches entretenidas\" by Mariana de Carvajal, the author considers that despite the title suggesting a winter and nocturnal story, the introduction of the work describes a beautiful garden full of fruit trees, flowers, and fountains, typically associated with spring and daylight. The garden belongs to Do\u00f1a Lucrecia de Haro, the aristocrat who lives near the Prado. Although the gatherings where the stories take place occur in an interior and nocturnal space of the house, the garden serves as an introduction and definition of the characters.\n         The author argues that Mariana de Carvajal does not use the garden as a narrative frame for the entire work, but as a rhetorical element in the definition of the characters. The garden represents the illustrious origin of the characters and situates them in a space that evokes the image of paradise. The work begins two years after the introduction, in the middle of winter, when Do\u00f1a Lucrecia becomes a widow, and her neighbors decide to distract her after the mourning period.\n"," This article establishes a comparison between Mar\u00eda de Zayas and Mariana de Carvajal. There are many points of contact, such as their cultivation of pagan literature, the use of the same genre, the short or courtly novel, the choice of Madrid, the focus on feminine themes, etc. However, there is a disparity in the attention of critics. Mar\u00eda de Zayas has been studied much more than Mariana de Carvajal, and at first, the latter has been categorized as a lower-quality imitation or emulation of the former. This article attempts to break this characterization and starts by drawing parallels with visual culture and art criticism, that is, the hierarchy between what happens in high spheres (generally the male world) and what happens in the domestic sphere. This is why the author believes that Mar\u00eda de Zayas has received more attention than Mariana de Carvajal. For the author, following critic Norman Byron, narrative art or megalography (the drama of the grand) has been exalted since antiquity over descriptive art, or rhopography (description of utensils, trifles, trivia, and all the inscription of the detritus of everyday life in art, called in Spain the still life). Both authors have been categorized as representatives of the two types of art. Critics have characterized Mariana de Carvajal as lacking the themes that are expected of a woman to develop, such as producing a feminist or pro-women worldview of the historical moment, as Mar\u00eda de Zayas did more explicitly. That is, she has been considered depoliticized and de-ideologized (50). Then the author destabilizes this division between rhopo and mega in the work of Mariana de Carvajal and suggests that there are overlaps or slippages between the two types of art (53). From page 54, the article approaches how Mar\u00eda de Zayas has been understood by critics as a proto-feminist touching on topics such as the yoke of women in a patriarchal society, the question of female desire, notions of motherhood, homosexuality, female community, the institution of marriage and adultery, social stigmas, etc. For the author, the still life appears in the work of Mar\u00eda de Zayas, albeit less literally but no less explicit (58). And for the author, the material, the objective, what is described, has a central place in the work of this author. According to Cirnigliaro, both authors use the material and the descriptive, although with different levels of literality, often merging the subjective and objective into a single unit. \"From the depths of the insignificant, trivial, and mundane, Carvajal and Zayas reflect on the 'big' problems of the Baroque subject, one of which is precisely the indissoluble relationship between the subject and 'the poetics of things' (59).\"","         The article analyzes the representation of aging in the works of Mar\u00eda de Zayas and Mariana de Carvajal. Both authors value the experience and wisdom that comes with age and suggest that maturity is a state in which women can achieve greater autonomy and control over their lives. The author of the article highlights the importance of gender in the construction of the figure of the matria, and how the writers used this concept to question and subvert the dominant gender norms of their time.\n         The study starts from an observation made by H. Nader about the women of the prominent Mendoza family in Spain who \"lived in a dual system, one in which patriarchy coexisted with matriarchy\" (197). In this context, the author briefly discusses the effect of widowhood on the lives of women in medieval and early modern Europe. Widowhood in many cases ensured greater autonomy for women, as they became owners of their own financial situation and often became \"the legal head of their household and the executor of their children's properties\" (198). In some cases, widowhood led to the formation of communities led by women, \"homes free from male authority, where the role of \"the mother\" was central\" (199).\n         The positive representation of aging leads Zayas and Carvajal to imagine a literary matria. Thus, the works of Zayas and Carvajal can be compared not only for the obvious similarities related to the gender and writing period of the authors, but also for fundamental shared characteristics.\n         The prose works of Zayas and Carvajal are generally considered to belong to the genre of courtly novel, and both authors include widows and their children as key protagonists in their narratives. Although both authors have many points in common, Zayas's literature has been more successful due to her range of more varied and potentially subversive endings.\n         In the works of both authors, the importance of the maternal figure is highlighted and how this figure can be an active and autonomous agent in their own lives. In this sense, widowhood is presented as an opportunity for older women to take control of their lives and become maternal figures for other characters.\n         Specifically, about Carvajal, the author points out that the emphasis is on marriage as the optimal outcome for younger protagonists, and older women eventually separate from their descendants as a result of their dominant activities. In contrast, Zayas's text presents a convent as a place of constant union between mothers and daughters, with older women playing a central and positive role in the outcome of the frame narrative. Zayas's matria is proposed as a utopian space, while Carvajal's is temporal and focused on marriage. However, the author concludes by saying that both authors imagine a matria of the early modern period that gives primacy to older women and has a subtext aimed at women.\n","          The article examines the visual effects in the works of Mar\u00eda de Zayas and Mariana de Carvajal, since both employed the traditional model of frame narrative and enclosed novel. The study, in turn, shows that the texts of Zayas and Carvajal can be usefully compared, as both authors effectively intertwined the verbal and visual to vividly portray an intimate domestic sphere within an urban environment. The article analyzes the visual details in their frame narratives in homes, including the symbolism of clothing, decoration, and food, and explores the social commentary on the changing situation of the urban nobility.\n          Using the long-established frame narrative model and enclosed novels, both authors use widows and their children as key protagonists of their frame narratives. Zayas and Carvajal begin their frame narratives by describing the circumstances of storytelling meetings. These meetings provide emotional support to a woman within her own home, and the goal is to offer comfort to newly widowed women. The authors also share the same spatial and temporal settings for their frame narratives, set in the court city of Madrid during the Christmas period, where the home becomes a refuge from the cold weather. Both authors refer to heating devices with similar fragrances, which were commonly used at that time. The authors wrote for the noble book buyer and reader, as was generally the case with the courtly novel genre. The study highlights the fundamental characteristics shared between the texts of Zayas and Carvajal, including the role of women in creating fictions by facilitating the oral narration of stories in their own homes, as well as the importance of the city as an integral feature of the courtly novel.\n          (From page 122) The author argues that Carvajal's texts are often ignored, but in her view, they reveal great talent for observing everyday life and describing home details. In this way, she disagrees with the assertion that Carvajal's prose is inferior to Zayas's in terms of \"description of clothing,\" and recognizes Bourland's reevaluation of Carvajal's prose as a significant contribution to the field. Both authors describe shared accommodations that facilitate interaction between the protagonists of the frame narrative. Zayas's descriptions of the narrative space are luxurious and reminiscent of an interior garden, while Carvajal dedicates considerable space to describing the home through her frame narrative hostess, Lucrecia de Haro. The article concludes that both authors represent domestic spaces in a pictorial way, with Carvajal's focus on home details and Zayas's on luxurious furniture.\n          The hostesses of social gatherings create a space worthy of eminent public figures within this select environment, painting a visual picture of idleness and ostentation with their words. Both authors include references to the outdoors and green imagery, denoting places of relative comfort. Ostentation was considered one of the causes of Spain's decline, and the luxurious clothing and extravagant lifestyles of the protagonists of Zayas and Carvajal's framed narratives do not seem to conflict with the contemporary status quo for the upper classes in Madrid.\n          (From page 126) Regarding the issue of clothing, the article describes how both authors detail it and use it to reveal the social status, loyalties, and emotions of their characters. The description of clothing in contemporary news pamphlets reflects the culture of appearances in seventeenth-century Spain. The clothing represented by Zayas and Carvajal is contrary to Castiglione's Book of the Courtier. In Zayas's Novelas amorosas y ejemplares, clothing and color speak a symbolic language and testify to the wearer's inner emotions. Carvajal also describes fine clothing, especially gifts exchanged between the protagonists of the frame narrative during the courtship process. Clothing is a \"used world\" that expresses social relationships. The exchange of gifts links the young protagonists of the framing narrative in their courtship relationships, using visual signals similar to Zayas' matching clothing. Clothing is also used to reveal the vices of 17th century Spanish society, such as excessive spending on luxurious clothing and effeminate clothing for men.\n         (From page 129) Regarding the representation of food in the narratives, the author suggests that while both authors describe food in their stories, Carvajal's descriptions are more vivid and imaginative, presenting contemporary dishes in sumptuous detail for the reader's delight. The thematic hunting cake of the nun described in Carvajal's text is an example of her use of ekphrastic language to represent culinary delights. Zayas, on the other hand, mentions the supply of chocolate, which was a symbol of wealth and fashionable status in 17th century Spain. The inclusion of chocolate in the texts of both authors contributes to the visualization of the privileged domestic world in which the stories unfold. Furthermore, the texts include elements of social criticism that focus on the visible predominance of ostentation in the world beyond the stories. Overall, the authors use descriptions of food and drink to enhance the sensory experience and understanding of the cultural and social context of the stories.\n          (From page 132) Finally, regarding social commentary, it is noted that the attraction of the aristocracy to ostentation was adopted by a much wider sector of Spanish society from the reign of the Catholic monarchs, which led to criticism from many Spanish arbitristas. The widespread habits of idleness and luxurious living were seen as the cause of Spain's misfortunes. The inherent waste of these habits was highlighted during the 17th century. Zayas and Carvajal explored the negative ramifications of ostentation, highlighting the blurring of class distinction lines. Both represent a relatively conservative attitude towards upward social mobility, considering it a destabilizing phenomenon facilitated by external ostentation. In Carvajal's novels, ostentatious objects were linked to social identity, especially at a time when the privileged position of the nobility was being challenged by the upward social mobility of others. It suggests that those who acquire wealth must learn socially and morally acceptable behavior appropriate for achieving proper assimilation. Carvajal's novels also feature social performances, especially evident in relation to the process of selecting a suitable marriage partner.\n","         The article analyzes how discourses in the early modern period in Spain constructed a representation of subjects, and how such discourses had a broad diffusion and influence in the following century. One of these discourses, the Examen de ingenios para las ciencias (1575) by Juan Huarte de San Juan, delimited the competencies and functions of men according to their ingenuity. While women were not the focus of this treatise, they were not absent from Huarte de San Juan's perspective. In contrast, two women writers, Mar\u00eda de Zayas and Mariana de Carvajal, resisted these biological and universal principles through the voices of their texts' enunciators and characters.\n         The argues argues that all discourses are historically and socially constructed practices, and that some have a power that imposes while others are \"peripheral murmurs of dissident groups.\" It is in the first, the social discourse, where the hegemony of what is thinkable and sayable is found. This hegemony legitimates certain thoughts as significant and certain intellectuals as the embodiment of an era, producing the dominance of certain semiotic facts that determine what is enunciable and deprive the unthinkable of means of enunciation. Discourses that deviate from the permissible enunciable are considered \"heteronomy.\"\n         The article concludes that in the early modern period in Spain, discourses from powerful groups modeled their subjects, resulting in a normative and performative policy. This process of subjectivity occurred gradually through hegemonic discourses like Huarte de San Juan's. In contrast, the discursive practices of Zayas and Carvajal, from an eccentric perspective, resist the hegemonic discourse's performativity based on biological determinism. Such practices, according to the article, resist performativity based on hegemonic discourses.\n         The author analyzes Huarte\u00b4s work pointing out that its the first scientific attempt to analyze human intelligence. The author argues that Huarte uses the topic of wit to differentiate among men's intellectual abilities and justify a system of control that would prevent the incompetent from occupying positions for which they were not qualified. The definition of wit is delimited from the field of natural philosophy, beyond Huarte's profession as a doctor. Huarte characterizes wit as the mind's fertility or the ability to generate concepts or representative figures of the nature of things, which would generate arts and sciences. Although women are not the central theme of the treatise, they are not exempt from analysis, and the author argues that Huarte's postulate on women's intellectual inferiority is based on a long tradition of misogyny. Huarte bases his argument on both theological and scientific explanations, concluding that women's natural composition in the brain is not capable of much wit or wisdom.\n         In her work Mar\u00eda de Zayas aims to show women as positioning herself in the cultural field dominated by male hegemonic power and proposes to do so not only as a woman but also as a woman with literary skills and in frank dissent with those who try to subject her and all women to biological determinism and thus limit their capacities. In the prologue to the \"Novelas amorosas y ejemplares\" (1637), she proposes equality between men and women with arguments from medical science, claiming that women may even be sharper, as they are \"colder by nature, as the mind consists of moisture\" (Zayas, 2010: 160). She bases her ideological position on equality and even the intellectual superiority of women, opposing the hegemonic discourse. Furthermore, her own ingenuity informs her that gender identity is a sociocultural construction that does not correspond to natural foundations. In the second prologue, it is affirmed that the female uterus and testicles, which are cold and humid, have informed the brain to conceive and give birth to ten children/books. This confirms what the enunciator of the first prologue had stated about women being colder and more humid by nature.\n         Zayas depicts her female characters as putting masculinity in check through deception and cleverness. The protagonist of El prevenido enga\u00f1ado, Don Fadrique, is tricked by several women in different ways that contradict his own principles. These include Serafina, who deceives him by concealing the birth of her child from a previous lover and later hides in a convent; Beatriz, who appears angelic but hides her amorous attentions to her servant; Do\u00f1a Violante, who initially accepts his advances but later deceives him with a young boy; and the Duchess, who seduces him but escapes discovery by telling her husband the truth through a cleverly constructed story. Don Fadrique believes that women should only know how to do their chores, pray, and raise children, and not engage in other activities, but many female characters in the work have talents such as reading, writing, and counting. In the end, Don Fadrique's own beliefs are challenged when he marries Gracia, whom he believes to be simple and ignorant, but who ultimately proves to be clever enough to deceive him.\n         Then, the author highlights that Mariana de Carvajal includes female protagonists who display their intelligence and independence. For instance, in the novel La venus de Ferrara, the widow Floripa must select a consort for her daughter and not impose her own desires. She and her daughter use a scheme to test the true intentions of five suitors, who must compete in masculine attributes like eloquence, bravery, and physical beauty. In El amante venturoso, Teodora manipulates her father into accepting her preferred suitor, while Lisena in Amar sin saber a qui\u00e9n reveals her intelligence and wit while playing a game of discovering her true love. These women prioritize their own happiness and desires in selecting a mate.\n"],["","","","Link: doi.org/10.1093/fmls/cqq084","Link: www.jstor.org/stable/23242199",""]]</p>
