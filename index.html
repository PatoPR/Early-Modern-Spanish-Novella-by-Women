In the 1630s, Zayas began writing novellas, a form of short prose fiction that explored themes of gender, power, and morality.

Bolea corresponded with notable scholars and writers, including Vincencio Juan de Lastanosa and Juan Francisco Andrés de Uztarroz. Her poetry can be found in a book titled Vigilia y Octaverio de San Juan Bautista (Zaragoza, 1679), which also includes a short novel and a novel.

Her literary accomplishments thrived under the reigns of Philip IV and Charles II, showcasing her prowess in both prose and verse compositions penned in the Spanish language.
Leonor originated from Lisbon, then a constituent of the Spanish Empire, as the offspring of Fernando de Meneses and María Freire y Andrada, the Marquises of Villarreal. While residing in Lisbon, she delved into the realms of languages and humanities, opting for a literary path instead of pursuing matrimonial commitments.
Leonor crafted a repertoire encompassing plays and courtly novels, with notable mention of "El desdeñado más firme" (preserved edition from 1655). ">
