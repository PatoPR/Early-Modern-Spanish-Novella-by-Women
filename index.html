Born in Madrid to an aristocratic family, Zayas was highly educated and moved into the highest social circles of her time.

In the 1630s, Zayas began writing novellas, a form of short prose fiction that explored themes of gender, power, and morality. Her first collection of novellas, Novelas amorosas y ejemplares, was published in 1637 and was a critical and commercial success. She published several more collections of novellas over the next decade.">

She came from a noble family and lived in the Real Monastery of Santa Maria de la villa in Casbas from an early age. Within the monastery, she immersed herself in various readings and even learned classical Latin. She became a religious member in 1624 and held positions of responsibility within the monastery. Bolea corresponded with notable scholars and writers, including Vincencio Juan de Lastanosa and Juan Francisco Andrés de Uztarroz. Her poetry can be found in a book titled Vigilia y Octaverio de San Juan Bautista (Zaragoza, 1679), which also includes a short novel and a novel. Her works exhibit sacred and popular themes, and she occasionally used the Aragonese language, showcasing the linguistic features of seventeenth-century Aragonese.">

Sadly, most of her work was lost after her death, but a few plays and poems were preserved. Egual's literature, characterized by a late Baroque style, encompassed various poetic forms, including the paradramatic colloquy. Some of her notable works include "El esclavo de su dama," "Los triunfos de Tesalia," and "Triunfos de amor en el aire."

Lisbon, September 4, 1640) was the inaugural Countess of Seren and the sixth Countess of Athouguia. She was a prominent Spanish writer during the Golden Age, widely recognized by her pen name Laura Mauricia, employed to protect her identity from the criticism faced by women writers of her era. Her literary accomplishments thrived under the reigns of Philip IV and Charles II, showcasing her prowess in both prose and verse compositions penned in the Spanish language.
Leonor originated from Lisbon, then a constituent of the Spanish Empire, as the offspring of Fernando de Meneses and María Freire y Andrada, the Marquises of Villarreal. While residing in Lisbon, she delved into the realms of languages and humanities, opting for a literary path instead of pursuing matrimonial commitments.
Leonor crafted a repertoire encompassing plays and courtly novels, with notable mention of "El desdeñado más firme" (preserved edition from 1655). ">

Carvajal was known for her literary talents and wrote several works, including plays and novels. Her most famous work is Navidades de Madrid y Noches entretenidas (1663), a collection of novellas that portrays the customs and daily life of seventeenth-century Madrid. Vivid descriptions, moralistic themes, and a critique of the ostentation and excesses of the Spanish nobility characterize Carvajal’s writing style. She was also one of the few female writers of her time to gain recognition and was highly regarded by her contemporaries. Today, Carvajal is considered an essential figure in Spanish literature and an example of the cultural and literary contributions of women in the Baroque era.">
