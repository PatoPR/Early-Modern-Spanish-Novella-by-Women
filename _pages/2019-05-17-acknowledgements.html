<p>UBC-Vancouver is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the <a href="https://indigenous.ubc.ca/indigenous-engagement/musqueam-and-ubc/?login">Musqueam</a> people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.</p>
