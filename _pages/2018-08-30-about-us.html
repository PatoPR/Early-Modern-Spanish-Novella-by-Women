<p>The 17th-century <em>novela corta</em>, or short prose fiction, occupies a fascinating and complex position within the landscape of Spanish literature. Despite lacking formal generic precepts and being associated with "lowly" entertainment, novellas were popular and allowed for literary experimentation, resulting in a wide range of subgenres that resist easy classification. As a reflection of an increasingly interconnected world shaped by exploration, trade, warfare, and migration, novellas are a crucial study site for understanding the hierarchies that defined the Early Modern period, including those that emerged in the Transatlantic and Mediterranean spaces.</p>
<p>Despite the growing academic interest, the field of 17th-century Spanish novella corta remains limited by a lack of resources devoted to the study of its female authors. This project aims to address this gap by bringing to light the contributions of the only four known female writers in this genre: María de Zayas y Sotomayor (1637 and 1647), Leonor de Meneses (1655), Mariana de Carvajal y Saavedra (1663), and Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea y Mur (1679). While some of their works have been studied in isolation, this project represents the first comprehensive study that examines these writers in a comparative manner and positions them within the larger context of late-stage novella creation in Spain. By doing so, this project contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the role of women in Early Modern Spanish literature and furthers scholarship on the novella corta.</p>
