<p><strong>Jennifer Nagtegaal</strong> is a Ph.D. candidate in Hispanic Studies at UBC. Jennifer’s M.A. and doctoral research, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), develops in the areas of animation studies and comics studies, respectively, and a number of recent projects at the intersection of both. This is the case of her monograph, <em>Politically Animated: Non-Fiction Animation from the Hispanic</em> <em>World</em>, forthcoming with the University of Toronto Press (August 2023). <em>Politically Animated </em>offers the first book-length study on animated non-fiction from the Spanish-speaking world.</p>
<p>Jennifer worked as a Graduate Research Assistant on this project from 2022-3. Jennifer’s early contributions focused on preparing a comprehensive bibliography for the women writers under study (specifically, primary and secondary sources for Leonor de Meneses and Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea), as well as the annotation of these two individual bibliographies. A second phase of her work saw the translation of these annotated bibliographies into English.</p>
