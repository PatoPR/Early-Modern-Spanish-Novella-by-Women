<p>Mariana de Carvajal y Saavedra (1604-1669) was a Spanish nun, writer, and literary figure of the Baroque era. She was born into a noble family in Madrid and entered the convent of Las Descalzas Reales at a young age. Carvajal was known for her literary talents and wrote several works, including plays and novels. Her most famous work is <em>Navidades de Madrid y Noches entretenidas</em> (1663), a collection of novellas that portrays the customs and daily life of seventeenth-century Madrid. Vivid descriptions, moralistic themes, and a critique of the ostentation and excesses of the Spanish nobility characterize Carvajal's writing style. She was also one of the few female writers of her time to gain recognition and was highly regarded by her contemporaries. Today, Carvajal is considered an essential figure in Spanish literature and an example of the cultural and literary contributions of women in the Baroque era.</p>
