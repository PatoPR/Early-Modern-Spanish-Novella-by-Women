<p>Our catalogue provides a comprehensive resource for those interested in the female contributors to the Spanish <em>novela corta</em> of the 17th century. Each author is represented by an annotated bibliography, highlighting their most important works, as well as key themes that emerge from their writing. Primary sources, such as original manuscripts or early printed editions, are also included where available, alongside secondary sources that provide additional context and analysis. By compiling these materials in one place, our catalogue aims to facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the contributions made by María de Zayas y Sotomayor, Leonor de Meneses, Mariana de Carvajal y Saavedra, María Egual and Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea y Mur to the literary landscape of Early Modern Spain.</p>
