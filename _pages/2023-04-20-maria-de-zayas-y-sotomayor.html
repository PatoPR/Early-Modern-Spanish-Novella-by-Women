<p>María de Zayas y Sotomayor (1590-1661) was a Spanish writer and poet who is widely regarded as one of the most important literary figures of the Baroque period. Born in Madrid to an aristocratic family, Zayas was highly educated and moved into the highest social circles of her time.</p>
<p>In the 1630s, Zayas began writing novellas, a form of short prose fiction that explored themes of gender, power, and morality. Her first collection of novellas, <em>Novelas amorosas y ejemplares</em>, was published in 1637 and was a critical and commercial success. She published several more collections of novellas over the next decade.</p>
